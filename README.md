# Live Coding Project: Teaching PDC Concepts
  
## Motivation
This project aims to teach students the concepts of Parallel and Distributed Computing (PDC) with minimal prior knowledge. 
Through live coding sessions, students can learn and apply PDC concepts like concurrency, asynchrony, locality and performance interactively.

## Concept Designs
- **Concurrency**: Managing multiple computations at the same time. [Concurrency Tutorial for CS1/CS2](LiveCoding_Concurrency_Simulating_Transportation.ipynb)
- **Asynchrony**: Handling operations that can proceed independently.
- **Locality**: Optimizing data access patterns to improve performance. [Locality Tutorial for Comp Org.](Live_coding_Data_Locality_ArrayVsLinkedList_Search.ipynb)
- **Performance**: Measuring and improving the efficiency of parallel and distributed systems.
