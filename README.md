# Live Coding Project: Teaching PDC Concepts

## Motivation
This project aims to teach students the concepts of Parallel and Distributed Computing (PDC) with minimal prior knowledge. 
Through live coding sessions, students can learn and apply PDC concepts like concurrency, asynchrony, locality and performance interactively.

## Concept Designs
### Overview
- **Introduction to PDC**: Basic definitions and importance.
- **Parallelism**: Concepts of parallel execution and parallel algorithms.
- **Distributed Systems**: Basics of distributed systems, communication, and coordination.
- **Topics**:
  a. **Concurrency**: Managing multiple computations at the same time.
  b. **Asynchrony**: Handling operations that can proceed independently.
  c. **Locality**: Optimizing data access patterns to improve performance.
  d. **Performance**: Measuring and improving the efficiency of parallel and distributed systems.
  
### Structure
1. **Introduction**: Brief introduction to the topic.
2. **Live Coding Examples**: Interactive coding sessions with step-by-step explanations.
