Understanding concurrency is crucial because it enables the efficient use of resources, improves performance, and is essential for developing responsive applications. In a world where computers are equipped with multiple cores, learning how to leverage concurrency can make a significant difference in the execution speed and responsiveness of programs.\n",

        "\n",
        "The code above is designed to visualize this sequential process:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The `transport_passengers` function simulates a bus moving across a fixed path and picking up passengers one by one.\n",
        "- The function iterates through each trip, moving the bus across the path, updating the number of passengers transported, and showing the state of the system.\n",
        "- Each time the bus completes a trip and returns, the program checks if there are more passengers to transport, and if so, starts the next trip.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach highlights the key characteristics of sequential execution: only one task (one trip) is processed at a time, and the next task must wait until the previous one is fully completed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Performance Metrics\n",
        "\n",
        "To measure the performance of this sequential approach, we introduce two key metrics:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Elapsed Time**: This is the total time taken to transport all the passengers from start to destination. It includes the time spent during each trip as well as the idle time between trips.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - **Measurement**: The elapsed time is recorded by capturing the time before starting the transportation and after all passengers have been transported. This gives us a clear measure of how long the entire process takes.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Throughput**: Throughput measures the rate at which passengers are transported, typically represented as passengers per second.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Measurement**: Throughput is calculated by dividing the total number of passengers transported by the elapsed time. A higher throughput indicates a more efficient process.\n",
        "\n",
        "These metrics are critical in assessing the efficiency of our approach. In the context of concurrency, they help us understand how much time we save and how much more work we can accomplish when tasks are handled concurrently rather than sequentially.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "In this part of the tutorial, we have introduced the concept of concurrency and demonstrated sequential execution using a live coding example. We also introduced key performance metrics—elapsed time and throughput—that will help us quantify the efficiency of different approaches. In the following sections, we will explore how concurrency can be implemented to improve the performance of this passenger transportation simulation."

        "### Introduction to Concurrency with Multiple Buses\n",
        "\n",
        "In the previous section, we explored sequential execution, where a single bus transported passengers from one stop to another, one by one. While this approach works, it is not efficient, especially when dealing with a large number of passengers. Now, we will introduce the concept of concurrency, which allows us to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, leading to faster and more efficient execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 1: Introducing Multiple Buses\n",
        "\n",
        "To begin with, let's think about how we might speed up the process of transporting passengers. One straightforward idea is to add more buses. Instead of just one bus making trips back and forth, we can have two buses working at the same time. This way, each bus can transport passengers independently, potentially halving the time it takes to transport everyone.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 2: Creating Separate Tasks with Threads\n",
        "\n",
        "To simulate the operation of two buses working simultaneously, we use a concept called *threads*. A thread is essentially a separate path of execution in your program. By using threads, we can have both buses running at the same time in our simulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the code provided:\n",
        "\n",
        "- We create two threads, each representing one of the buses (`🚗` and `🚙`).\n",
        "- Each thread runs the same function, `transport_passengers`, but they operate independently of each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "At this stage, it's important to note that each bus is still working with its own set of tasks—picking up passengers, transporting them, and returning for more. These tasks happen in parallel, thanks to the use of threads.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 3: Managing Shared Resources\n",
        "\n",
        "However, there is one important detail to consider: both buses are working towards the same goal of transporting all passengers. This means they share a common resource—the total number of passengers left to be transported. When multiple threads share data, it’s crucial to ensure that they don’t interfere with each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "Without proper management, both buses might try to pick up the same passengers at the same time, leading to errors in our simulation. This situation is known as a *race condition*.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 4: Synchronization with Locks\n",
        "\n",
        "To prevent race conditions, we introduce a concept called *locks*. A lock ensures that only one thread can access the shared resource at a time. When one bus (or thread) is updating the number of passengers, the other bus has to wait its turn. This ensures that our data stays consistent and accurate.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the code:\n",
        "\n",
        "- A `lock` is used to synchronize access to the shared resource (`passengers_transported`).\n",
        "- Each time a bus (thread) wants to update the number of passengers transported, it first acquires the lock. Once it’s done, it releases the lock so the other bus can proceed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 5: Visualizing Concurrent Execution\n",
        "\n",
        "With these concepts in place—multiple threads, shared resources, and locks—we can now run our simulation:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Two buses operate concurrently, transporting passengers simultaneously.\n",
        "- The shared state (the number of passengers transported) is safely updated using locks.\n",
        "- The visualization function (`visualize_trip`) shows the current state of the buses, allowing us to see how both buses are working together to complete the task faster.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Performance Metrics in Concurrent Execution\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, just as we did with the sequential version, we measure the performance of this concurrent implementation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Elapsed Time**: This is the total time taken from when the first bus starts until the last bus finishes transporting all passengers. With two buses working together, we expect this time to be shorter than the sequential version.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Throughput**: Throughput is calculated as the total number of passengers transported divided by the elapsed time. With concurrency, throughput should increase, reflecting the improved efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "By introducing concurrency gradually, we've seen how adding a second bus and using threads can significantly improve the efficiency of our passenger transportation simulation. However, with concurrency comes the need to manage shared resources carefully using locks to prevent race conditions. In the next section, we will delve deeper into the benefits and challenges of concurrent programming, as well as explore further optimizations.\n"
